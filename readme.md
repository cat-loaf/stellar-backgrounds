# Stellar Backgrounds

Welcome to the Stellar Backgrounds repository! This project showcases a collection of cool website backgrounds designed to enhance the visual appeal of your web pages.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a simple HTML and CSS setup that demonstrates a beautiful moving background effect. The main focus is on creating visually appealing backgrounds that can be easily integrated into any website.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains styles for the webpage, including the background animation.
- `star.png`: The image used for the moving star background.
- `old_star.png`: An older version of the star image.
- `site.webmanifest`: The web app manifest file for adding the website to the home screen on mobile devices.
- Various favicon and icon files for different devices and screen sizes.

## Usage

## Customization

Feel free to customize the background images, colors, and animations to suit your needs. You can replace the `star.png` image with your own images and adjust the CSS properties in `style.css` to create different effects.
